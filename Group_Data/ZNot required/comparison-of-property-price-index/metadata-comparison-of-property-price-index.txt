Title: 'Private Property Price Index by Type, Quarterly'
Description:
  - 'The residential statistics were compiled from information in caveats lodged at
    the option stage with the Singapore Land Registry, supplemented with Stamp Duty
    data from the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore, as well as data provided
    by developers for new sales. A caveat is normally lodged by a purchaser to protect
    his/her interest of a property shortly after the option to purchase is exercised.  The
    prices in 2009-Q1 are used as the base reference price of the index. The indices
    are compiled based on a Stratified Hedonic Regression method.  The value of properties
    transacted in the past 5 quarters are used as weights.  The weights are revised
    every 3 years.  The latest revision was in 2015-Q1.'
